I also added feta cheese and kalamata olives to the mix. Instead of chicken tenders slathered some of the oil/lemon juice mixture with garlic onto chicken breasts and cooked them in that. Spread the oil mix onto the tortilla and then piled everything into the tortilla. Also used roasted garlic and olive oil couscous. The flavors in this wrap are amazing. Definitely try this.
